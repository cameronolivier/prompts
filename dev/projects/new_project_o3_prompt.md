# Initial Prompt for o3 Deep Research
```
I want to build a [thing to build]

I want to use t3 app:
https://create.t3.gg/en/installation
it's a stack that uses nextjs, trpc, tanstack query, typescript, drizzle orm, zod and tailwind.
It also has an env validation library using zod. 
using the app folder structure: https://create.t3.gg/en/folder-structure-app
using the typescript, drizzle options. Here's first steps setup: https://create.t3.gg/en/usage/first-steps

I'll also be using shadcn. and want to use supabase to handle my auth and db potentially file storage and other features as well if needed.

i want you to do research on:
- what additional frameworks or apis exist for this problem
- what pages we'd need, 
- what db structure would be required and recommend schema
- what are the recommended page layout from a best-practice UX point of view for each of the pages
- what have other similar apps used
- what is the simplest best-ux approach 
- I want the app to be super simple and easy to use.
- what are the best practices and approaches to create this
- what architecture makes the most sense
- any specific libraries or services that could make our job easier
```
