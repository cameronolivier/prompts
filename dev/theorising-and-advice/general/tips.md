These AI prompt tricks work so well it feels like cheating

I discovered these while defaulting on actual work. They're embarrassingly simple but turn AI from a search engine into an actual thinking partner:

1. Add "Walk me through your reasoning"

Instead of just getting an answer, you see how it arrived there. Game-changer for complex decisions. "Should I quit my job? Walk me through your reasoning."

2. Use "What's the contrarian view here?" 

Instantly breaks out of echo chambers. It'll argue against its own first response and find angles you missed completely.

3. Say "Assume I know nothing"

Even for topics you understand. "Explain cryptocurrency assuming I know nothing" gets you foundations that reveal gaps in your knowledge.

4. Ask "What questions should I be asking instead?"

This one's sneaky good. Often the question you asked isn't the right question, and this finds the better one.

5. Use "Give me the version for beginners, then for experts"

Two explanations in one shot. The beginner version clarifies concepts, the expert version gives you depth to sound smart.

6. End with "What would make this backfire?"

The reality check you need. Every strategy has failure modes, and this surfaces them before you commit.

The weird part is these work because they force AI out of "helpful assistant" mode into "thinking partner" mode. It stops trying to please you and starts trying to solve with you.

Plot twist: The magic happens when you chain them. "What's the contrarian view on remote work? Walk me through your reasoning. What would make this backfire?"

Most people use AI like a fancy autocomplete. These make it think alongside you instead of just completing your thoughts.

What's your best "wait, that actually worked?" prompt discovery?
